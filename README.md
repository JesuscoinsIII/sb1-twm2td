## EthDenver SporkDao Proposal
	
Including a request for funding support and offering ETHDenver attendees or SporkDAO partial exclusivity is a bold, collaborative proposition that could strengthen your pitch.

Here‚Äôs how it could look with this addition:

**Hackathon Proposal: "Hack the Bus" ‚Äì Road to ETHDenver**

**Objective:** Our goal is to create a unique, mobile hackathon experience called **"Hack the Bus"** that engages the community en route to ETHDenver 2025 and on-site. This initiative combines exclusive, collaborative challenges with ETHDenver's spirit of innovation, bringing hackers together from across the country in a fully equipped mobile hackathon space.

**Overview:**

-   **Vehicle Lease Cost:** $30,000 (3 months)
-   **Exclusive Rights Duration:** Up to 18 months, providing long-term access to leverage this mobile hackathon concept for future events.
-   **Purpose:** To foster innovation, community engagement, and collaborative challenges with participants, partners, and collaborators.

**Concept Details:**

-   **"Hack the Bus" Journey to ETHDenver:** We‚Äôll travel from Dallas, Texas, to ETHDenver with planned stops at key locations to engage local communities, onboard participants, and start the hackathon experience before we even reach Denver.
-   **On-Board Challenges:** Throughout the journey, we will host hackathon-style challenges, allowing participants to begin creating and collaborating as they travel. This unique format will encourage brainstorming and prototyping across diverse groups, ultimately leading to high-impact projects by the time we arrive.
-   **ETHDenver On-Site Challenges:** At ETHDenver, the "Hack the Bus" vehicle will serve as a creative hub, where participants can join timed challenges, collaborate with other teams, and engage in cross-disciplinary projects focused on blockchain, decentralized applications, and other themes central to ETHDenver.
-   **Outside Collaboration:** We envision collaboration with other ETHDenver attendees, allowing them to participate in challenges within the bus or contribute remotely. This collaborative element will enable a seamless integration with the ETHDenver experience and foster connections with a broader audience.

**Strategic Partnerships:** To amplify the impact of "Hack the Bus," we are strategically partnering with a select group of **brands, products, and industry influencers** whose values align with ETHDenver and our mission. These partners will contribute resources, mentorship, and exposure, enhancing the overall hackathon experience for participants. Together, we aim to create a memorable journey that celebrates the power of collaboration and innovation on the road to ETHDenver.

**Funding Request and Exclusive Collaboration Opportunity:** To make "Hack the Bus" a reality, we are seeking support from ETHDenver and SporkDAO to help fund the vehicle lease. In return, we would love to offer ETHDenver attendees and SporkDAO partial exclusivity of the vehicle for up to 18 months, enabling them to use it as a mobile innovation lab for future events, hackathons, and collaborations. This partnership would foster quicker development and wider community engagement, allowing ETHDenver and SporkDAO to continue the "Hack the Bus" legacy and extend the impact beyond this single event.

**Support Request:** To ensure this initiative‚Äôs success, we are requesting ETHDenver's support for:

1.  **Event Integration:** Assistance in coordinating on-site positioning of the "Hack the Bus" vehicle and integration with ETHDenver‚Äôs schedule for visibility.
2.  **Logistical Support:** Guidance and support to ensure smooth participation in ETHDenver, including any technical or organizational requirements.
3.  **Promotion:** Help in promoting the "Hack the Bus" initiative to ETHDenver attendees and the broader community, to maximize engagement.
4.  **Funding Support:** Assistance with funding the $30,000 vehicle lease, with the offer of partial exclusivity for up to 18 months as a collaborative development opportunity.

**Why This Matters:** "**Hack the Bus**" aligns with ETHDenver‚Äôs mission by creating a unique environment that promotes community-building and innovation. By partnering with ETHDenver, SporkDAO, and aligned brands, we can elevate the experience and foster rapid development and creativity. This hackathon will allow participants to push boundaries, collaborate with new minds, and create impactful solutions both on the road and at ETHDenver.

We are excited to bring this mobile hackathon to life and to collaborate with ETHDenver to make it a memorable experience. Please let us know how we can work together to enhance the event and provide an immersive journey that captures the essence of ETHDenver‚Äôs vision.
